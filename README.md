# purescript-lambness

Takes bits from [purescript-lambs](https://github.com/Glorp/purescript-lambs) and makes something that can kind of be used as a JS lib for doing lambdastuffs.

I tend to forget how to:
 * `bower install`
 * `pulp build`
 * `pulp psci`
 * `pulp browserify --optimise --standalone lambs --to lambs.js`
